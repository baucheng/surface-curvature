# surface-curvature
1. The project is to represent a surface in 3D, using the libraries of scipy, numpy in python.

2. The maximum and the minimum curvatures of the surface are calculated and with the help of these curvatures
The gaussian and the mean curvatures of a surface are calulated. 

The use of the gaussian curvature is useful to distinguish the surface points into distinct categories ie. elliptical points(K>0),
hyperbolic points(K<0) and parabolic points (K=0)

Gaussian and mean curvature are often used for visual inspection of surfaces
